# multitask training of topographic RNN models

Pytorch implementation of multitask RNN training (original TensorFlow code [here](https://github.com/gyyang/multitask)):

This was forked from the [RNN_multitask](https://github.com/benhuh/RNN_multitask) repo, which was prepared for the [Harvard-MIT Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience Journal Club](https://compneurojc.github.io/).
A full RNN tutorial repo can be found [here](https://github.com/jennhu/rnn-tutorial).

Here, we modify the RNN to include spatial and sign-based constraints and to allow for multiple RNN areas, following the work of Blauch, Behrmann, Plaut (2022).

A demo notebook is provided at `multitask_demo.ipynb`, based off of the original repo.

Modified RNN code is found in `ei_rnn.py`. Wiring cost computations are performed within `wiring_cost.py`

Within `wiring_cost.py`, we also include an implementation of the spatially-embedded recurrent neural network (SeRNN) optimization function, along with other alternatives designed to highlight the flexibility of spatial wiring costs.
